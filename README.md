> What if The Phoenix Flavour, but Patchafied?


## Requirements

To properly enjoy this list, you'll need to do a little grocery shopping:

- A clean, LEGAL installation of Skyrim Special Edition. I don't tolorate piracy.
- The Wabbajack program itself, available from https://www.wabbajack.org/#/.
- AT LEAST an additional 150GB of free space. Enough for the list with some room to spare.
- (Optional) A firm understand of Theoretical Physics and at least one degree in Astronomy


## Installation

First off, clear any existing Skyrim Special Edition installs you might have. Do this by manually going into the installtion folder (i.e. steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition), select everything within it, and hit Delete. 

Next up, right-click on the game within your steam liberary, and go to Properties, then Local Files, then Verify integrity of game files. This will install a totally clean copy of Skyrim, free of any trace of previous modding. 

While this downloads, go to Documents/My Games/, and delete the Skyrim Special Edition folder found there. We want to generate fresh INI files upon first launch.

Once Skyrim Special Edition finishes downloading, go ahead and run the game once to generate those brand-new INI files. You can close the launcher after it determines your graphics settings, as they will be overwritten by the modlist itself. Afterwards, consider going back into the Properties, then Updates, and changing Automatic Updates to "Only update this game when I launch it" to avoid any nasty surprises should Bethesda decide to update the CC content.

Now that we have Skyrim ready to go, go ahead and open the Wabbajack program you downloaded from the site (you did do this, right?) and click "Browse Modlists". You will see one named "I Can Hear You Shouting", and if you don't, you can search for it right there on the UI. Once you find it, click the down arrow to download it.

Once the list is ready to install, you will be presented with a screen asking you for an install and download location. You can set these however you want, but here are a few rules and suggestions:
 - You cannot install the modlist to either your Skyrim install location or to Program Files.
 - Most of these lists are fairly large, so make sure you have more space than you need. Always have a cushion.
 - It is highly recommended that these lists be installed on an SSD, along with the game you're modifying.
 - The downloads folder will default to your chosen install location, but you may change it if you wish.

Once you've decided where to install the list and where the downloads go, simply click the green Play arrow, and Wabbajack will take care of the rest. (if you don't have Nexus Premium, be advised that you will need to MANUALLY tell WJ to download the archives, which you will be guided through.)


## Finalzing your installation and first launch

Once Wabbajack informs you that your installation is complete, you may close it, and go to your earlier-designated installation location for I Can Hear You Shouting.

Opening this installation folder, you will be presented with a folder named Game Folder Files. Open this folder and copy everything within it to your Skyrim Special Edition install location. (i.e. steamapps/common/Skyrim Special Edition)

Return to your I Can Hear You Shouting install location and run ModOrganizer.exe. This will open up Mod Organizer, our chosen...well...mod organizer for this modlist. When you're ready to play, simply choose SKSE from the dropdown in the top right and hit Run. This should take you right into the main menu. From here, just hit New Game, and be ready for the fun part: setting your MCMs.


## MCM settings

A Matter of Time - Go to Presets and choose "Load User Settings". (This is Phoenix's preset. I like it a lot, but you may tweak it if you wish.)

All Geared Up Derivative - In the NPC tab, check Enable Weapons.

Cathedral Weathers - Uncheck Configuration Spell (redundant when you can access the MCM).

Immersive HUD - Check "Link ALL SkyUI Widgets" and "Key press toggles".

moreHUD (Enemy's Level tab) - Uncheck "Show Magicka Meter" and "Show Stamina Meter"

Realistic Water Two - Under Mod Options » Blacksmith Forge Water, check "Kynesgrove" and "Rorikstead"

Timing Is Everything (Extra Options tab) - Click "Load Preset". Follow on-screen prompts until settings are fully loaded.

Trade & Barter - Under Barter Rates » Settings, check the Modify Barter Settings box.

Wonders of Weather - Under Rainsplashes, set Level to Disabled to turn the effect off. (Totally Optional)
